//! A congestion-window ceiling, layered on top of any other
//! `quinn_proto::congestion::Controller`.
//!
//! Found by real testing (see `quic_rs_transport.py`'s module docstring,
//! "KNOWN, UNRESOLVED LIMITATION"): a single message larger than roughly
//! 5-10MB reliably stalled the connection completely. Root cause, confirmed
//! by reading `quinn-proto`'s own source rather than guessing: this
//! project's deployment machines cap `net.core.rmem_max`/`wmem_max` at
//! 212992 bytes (208 KiB, confirmed via `sysctl` on both machines, see the
//! `project_os_udp_buffer_ceiling` memory entry) and cannot raise it from
//! inside the container. `NewReno` (the default controller) is free to grow
//! its congestion window arbitrarily large for a sustained transfer -
//! `quinn_proto::congestion::NewRenoConfig` exposes `initial_window` but no
//! maximum-window cap (confirmed by reading `congestion/new_reno.rs`
//! directly: `window` only ever grows on ACK, or resets to
//! `minimum_window()` on loss - there is no ceiling field anywhere). Once
//! the window grows past what the OS socket buffers can actually hold for a
//! large enough transfer, the connection bursts more data onto the wire
//! than the kernel can buffer, causing self-induced packet loss at the
//! socket layer - invisible to and unrelated to any QUIC-level flow-control
//! window (`send_window`/`receive_window`/`stream_receive_window`), which is
//! why raising those (tested up to 200 MiB) did not help even slightly.
//!
//! The fix here does not depend on network RTT happening to pace bursts
//! naturally (which only helps on a real, non-loopback link, and was never
//! confirmed - see `quic_rs_transport.py`'s module docstring for the
//! abandoned cross-machine test attempt): it clamps the reported congestion
//! window
//! itself, at the source, regardless of how large the wrapped controller's
//! internal state grows. `quinn-proto`'s own `write_limit()` computation
//! (`connection/streams/state.rs`) already gates every write against
//! `Controller::window()` amongst other things, so capping what this method
//! *returns* is sufficient to cap how much can ever be in flight
//! unacknowledged - no change to `write_limit()` itself, or to the wrapped
//! controller's internal slow-start/congestion-avoidance/loss-recovery
//! logic, is needed.
