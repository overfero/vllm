//! `Engine`: drives one `quinn_proto::Endpoint` + (once established) one
//! `quinn_proto::Connection` for a single peer-to-peer link - the Rust
//! analogue of `quic_transport.py`'s `QUICTransport`/`_QuicAdapterProtocol`,
//! built on `quinn-proto` (sans-io) instead of `aioquic`.
//!
//! Unlike aioquic's single `QuicConnection` object, quinn-proto splits
//! per-socket state (`Endpoint`) from per-connection state (`Connection`),
//! with a bidirectional event-passing protocol between them
//! (`Connection::poll_endpoint_events()` -> `Endpoint::handle_event()` one
//! way, `Endpoint::handle()`'s `DatagramEvent::ConnectionEvent` ->
//! `Connection::handle_event()` the other way). This is unavoidable -
//! `Endpoint` is required even for exactly one connection, confirmed against
//! quinn-proto's own docs (there is no lighter-weight single-connection
//! constructor) - so `Engine` always owns both, draining the endpoint-event
//! loop to a fixed point after every operation that mutates the connection,
//! same as quinn's own internal driving pattern.
//!
//! No socket I/O of any kind happens in this crate (see module docstring
//! for `lib.rs`) - bytes come in via `receive_datagram`, bytes go out via
//! the `Vec<(Vec<u8>, SocketAddr)>` results returned from every method that
//! can produce them, mirroring `quic_transport.py`'s `_transmit()`.
